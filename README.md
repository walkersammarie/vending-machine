# vending-machine
This was my first Java project after only 4 weeks of study. Use this link to get your own virtual snacks and drinks: 
https://vending-machine-2000.glitch.me/.

The project requirements can be found in the file labeled "Module 1 Capstone - Vending Machine Terminal.pdf".

Here is a broad overview:
- the vending machine can be fed money
- the user can then make purchases from a list of digital snacks/drinks
- the user can get their change
- the machine owner can update the vending machine's inventory by change the inventory.txt file
- the machine owner can see current inventory and how much money was made by viewing the generated sales report
- the machine owner can see all vending machine actions including when money was fed, when items were purchased, and when a transaction completed with specific information listed such as date, time, item, amount, balance, and change
